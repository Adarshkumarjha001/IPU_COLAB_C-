Problem Statement



Vishnu is developing a geometry application that requires calculations related to lines. The program should be utilized to calculate the distance between two points and find the midpoint of a line segment.



Create a structure named Line to store the coordinates of a point, say x and y. Find the distance between two Points.



The distance between two points is given by the Euclidean formula.





Also find the midpoint of the line formed by two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2):







Note: This is a sample question asked in an Amcat interview.

Input format :
The first line of input is the value of X1 and Y1, separated by a space.

The next line is the value of X2 and Y2, separated by a space.

Output format :
The first line of output prints the distance between two points.

The next line prints the midpoint.



Refer to the sample output for the exact format.

Code constraints :
X1, X2 >=0

Y1, Y2>=0

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
1 1
2 2
Output 1 :
Distance: 1.41
Midpoint: 1.50 1.50
Input 2 :
3 2
4 1
Output 2 :
Distance: 1.41
Midpoint: 3.50 1.50

#include<cmath>
using namespace std;
struct Line{
    float x1,y1;
    float x2,y2;
};
int main(){
    struct Line s;
    cin>>s.x1>>s.y1;
    cin>>s.x2>>s.y2;
    float a=(s.x1+s.x2)/2;
    float b=(s.y1+s.y2)/2;
    float c=sqrt(pow((s.x2-s.x1),2)+pow((s.y2-s.y1),2));
    cout<<fixed<<setprecision(2)<<"Distance: "<<c<<endl;
    cout<<fixed<<setprecision(2)<<"Midpoint: "<<a<<" "<<fixed<<setprecision(2)<<b;
    return 0;
}
